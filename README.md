# Integrated Smart Home Security and Energy Management System

The project is divided into two parts
1. Security System
Fingerprint Module (R305):
Adds and verifies fingerprints for secure access.
Enhances user safety by limiting access to authorized personnel.

Keypad (4x4):
Serves as a backup access method in case the fingerprint system is unavailable.

Camera Recognition:
Activates after three failed access attempts.
Captures and sends an image of the individual to the authorized user for immediate notification.

Solenoid Lock:
Engages or disengages access control, securing the physical entry point.

2. Automation System
Temperature & Humidity Sensor:
Monitors environmental conditions and shares data with a Bluetooth-connected device.
Supports energy-saving actions, such as adjusting cooling or heating systems.

Flame Sensor:
Detects potential fire hazards and issues an early warning.

Switch and Relay:
Controls electrical devices based on sensor inputs, enabling automated and efficient energy management.

Equipment used 
Arduino Mega: Acts as the system's control hub.
ESP8266: Provides Wi-Fi connectivity for remote alerts and monitoring.
Raspberry Pi: Powers image capture and processing functionalities.
FHD Webcam: Captures high-quality images for security notifications.
Buzzer: Alerts users to unauthorized access attempts or detected risks.
Switch and Relay: Facilitate controlled automation of connected devices.
